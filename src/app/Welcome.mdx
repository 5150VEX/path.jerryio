## Introduction

PATH.JERRYIO is a multi-purpose path editor/planner which can be used to design routes for one-minute driver skill and generate path files.
More information about the editor can be found on the [GitHub Page](https://github.com/Jerrylum/path.jerryio).


## Getting Started

Before you start, please make sure you understand the following terms:

<div style={{ position: "relative" }}>
<img src={TermsAndConceptBackground} alt="" width="100%" />
<TermsAndConceptOverlay style={{ position: "absolute", left: 0, top: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }} />
</div>

PATH.JERRYIO is using 

by multiple b√©zier curves

a concept called "Path" to represent a route. A path is a sequence of lines and curves. Each line and curve is called a "Path Segment". A path segment is defined by two points. The first point is the end point of the previous path segment. The second point is the start point of the next path segment. A path segment can be a line or a curve. A line is defined by two points. A curve is defined by four points. The first and last points are the start and end points of the curve. The second and third points are the control points that define the shape of the curve. Only end points have heading attributes.

Bazier Curve: A curve that is defined by four points. The first and last points are the start and end points of the curve. The second and third points are the control points that define the shape of the curve.

Only end points have heading attributes. Modify ...
